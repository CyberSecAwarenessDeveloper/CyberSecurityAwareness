AI could be useful in helping people understand their network and infrastructure but that introduces a gigantic security risk as we would need to provide this sensitive data to external models, or require people to train their own models based on their network data (and at this point, what is the difference between learning IT vs training a model on your infrastructure?",There are no obstacles to learning.,No,,"AI is not the future in cybersecurity, from the perspective of vendors and from the end user side. We should not be granting access to internal networks for tools you do not fully understand and closed source AI models are exactly the black box tool that you cannot audit. If you are capable of building and training your own models from open source options, then you probably already understand security fundamentals given your technical understanding.

AI tools can be used to guide people to learning but I firmly believe that digital learning can only be generic.

Personalized advice requires knowledge of your infrastructure, so either that needs to come from within (by applying generic information), or from a person who can be audited."
